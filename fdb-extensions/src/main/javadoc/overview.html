Extensions to the FoundationDB Java API.

<p>
This utility library contains several durable data structures as well as utility functions that extend the base
functionality of the FoundationDB Java API. They are developed together with the
<a href="https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-record-layer/">Record Layer</a> project, but they may be generally
useful to users of the FoundationDB Java API.
</p>

<p>
Many of the functions here are unstable as they serve primarily as utility functions for the Record Layer and
are subject to change at short notice. To assist users with understanding whether a function is stable or unstable
(and therefore liable to change with little warning), this project also includes a set of
{@link com.apple.foundationdb.annotation.API API} stability annotations. They are used throughout the Record Layer.
Users are encouraged to check the API stability of any class or method before using it within their own project.
</p>

<p>
This library and the <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/org.foundationdb/fdb-record-layer-core/"><code>fdb-record-layer-core</code></a>
project are versioned together. It is <em>highly</em> recommended that any users of the
Record Layer use the same version for this library as for the core library as no other configurations are
tested or supported.
